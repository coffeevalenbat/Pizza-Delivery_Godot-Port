This is an attempt to make an accurate and accessible port of [Jefftastic](https://github.com/jefftasticgames)'s Pizza Delivery running on the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/), originally made with the **Snap!** web platform.

Click [here](https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?user=jeffreymarx&project=Pizza%20Delivery!) to play the original game.

### Original game credits:

 - [Postman](https://twitter.com/CreatorPostman) (Intro cutscene)
 - [Coffee Bat](https://twitter.com/Cofebbat) (Soundtrack)

This whole port was made by me in a couple of hours (Plus some days of bugfixing and cleaning), with the original aim of it being added to Pizza Delivery 2 (Still in development).
